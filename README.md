Description:

With the assets given to you, remake the following Project : Advice Generator.



Requirements:

Built in React
Use https://api.adviceslip.com/advice for your API call
Must have a component folder ( App cannot be built in the app.js or in the index.js)
Responsive to Mobile and Desktop versions
Must use all assets given
You can use bootstrap or tailwind
Goal is to recreate this challenge as close to the design as possible and having it function properly.

Peer Review: Juan Heredia
"Computer and phone look fine, maybe make the "Advice #" bigger? looks really small also when you transition from desktop to phone it looks weird, you should probably have the divider image change at an earlier resolution also change the title so it isnt the default."
